I did not consult with classmates in person on this assignment due to my schedule this week, but I engaged with some classmates on discord. I attended TA hours on February 13th to finalize my code. Talking to people in various mediums made me realize that Java is simpler than it may have seemed at first. Initially, I don't really have a lot of thoughts on Java. It isn't harder or easier than Python as far as I can tell, just different. I kind of like it so far. In terms of conclusions, I think that maybe all programming languages may be different, but it is possible to do the same sorts of things with them. That is to say that there is more than one path to the end goal (like, I could've coded this assignment in Python as well). 

What worked best for me was probably just using online resources (specifically W3 schools) to read about Java syntax rather than just being confused or feeling the need to admit defeat. As long as I know what to look for, I can handle a lot of debugging and looking for syntax on my own. I would advise someone to come into this assignment with an open mind and be patient with themselves.

I will say that I am still confused on what counts as a "round" of conversation, but I set my code to run according to what seemed like a round to me. That isn'ta coding issue so much as it is an issue of clarity of instructions.
